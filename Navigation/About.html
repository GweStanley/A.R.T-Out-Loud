  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>A.R.T Out Loud is a charitable platform that harnesses the healing power of poetry and creative expression to promote emotional, mental, and spiritual wellness. We believe that art, in all its forms, provides a voice for the voiceless, a sanctuary for the hurting, and a bridge to personal growth and community understanding.</p>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p>We collect and share heartfelt poems, spoken word, and other creative works from individuals around the world. These works are curated and published to inspire healing in communities affected by trauma, grief, isolation, or marginalization. We also provide opportunities for workshops, live readings, and therapeutic art sessions.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Healing doesn't always come from medicine. Sometimes, it comes from words. From shared stories. From the beauty of rhythm and metaphor. A.R.T Out Loud gives people the tools to express their journeys, connect with others, and find peace through creativity.</p>
